use "python detect.py --slice_size 1024" to specify the slice size
use "python detect.py" for automatic slicing

image directory = image will be used for predictions, not part of the dataset
models directory = yolo models that can be used
runs directory = yolo and sahi inferences outputs
- runs/detect/predict# = yolo inferences
- runs/predict/exp# = sahi inferences
- charts = charts plotting of the results (box size distrib, confidence distrib, detection counts, detection summary)



Explanation for Slicing

For 1920x1080 image with 512x512 pixel slices and 0.2 overlap ratio:
First, the algorithm calculates the actual overlap in pixels:
Horizontal overlap: 512 × 0.2 = 102 pixels
Vertical overlap: 512 × 0.2 = 102 pixels
It starts from the top-left (0,0) and creates slices row by row:
Row 1 (y=0):
Slice 1: (0,0,512,512)
Slice 2: (410,0,922,512) [starts at 512-102=410]
Slice 3: (820,0,1332,512)
Slice 4: (1230,0,1742,512)
Slice 5: (1408,0,1920,512) [adjusted to fit image width]
Row 2 (y=410):
Slice 6: (0,410,512,922)
Slice 7: (410,410,922,922)
Slice 8: (820,410,1332,922)
Slice 9: (1230,410,1742,922)
Slice 10: (1408,410,1920,922)
Row 3 (y=820):
Slice 11: (0,820,512,1080) [adjusted to fit image height]
Slice 12: (410,820,922,1080)
Slice 13: (820,820,1332,1080)
Slice 14: (1230,820,1742,1080)
Slice 15: (1408,820,1920,1080)
